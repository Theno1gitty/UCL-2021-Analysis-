To make this code, I relied on what I learnt in the IBM "Data Science" course in Coursera. I made this in the summer break before joining grade 9, and decided to upload it now. 
At the time, I was unfamiliar with some of the statistics jargon, so some analyses might be incorrectly executed because of the use of wrong methods. For some complicated code, I asked Gemini 
for help, and have indicated so with comments. If visible in Google Colab, I have also added my interpretation of the data in English. 

I got the data from kaggle. I had to manipulate the data to analyse it, as it was separated by category (like goals, defending, goalkeeping, etc.). 

Although complex, so far, this program can analyse any UCL related data, but to actually analyse it, you might have to delete some cells as they may be unnecessary or cause bugs. 

I hope you enjoy using my program. If there is any feedback you have for me, please feel free to reach out! I would be more than happy to act upon it!
